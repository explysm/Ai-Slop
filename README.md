# AI Slop

> A collection of software completely generated by various Large Language Models (LLMs).
>
> Even this README is made by AI.

This repository is an experiment to showcase the capabilities and quirks of AI-generated code. It serves as a playground for exploring what happens when you let language models build software from scratch.

## About The Project

This project was started as a fun way to explore the world of AI-driven development. All the code you see here is generated by AI, with minimal human intervention. The goal is to see how far we can push the boundaries of what's possible with current LLM technology.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, simply clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username/ai-slop.git
```

## Usage

Feel free to browse the code, run the projects (if they work!), and see what the AIs have come up with. Each project will be in its own directory, with its own set of instructions.
